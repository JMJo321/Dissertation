Exploring participating households' electricity consumption, according to a time sequence around the peak rate period, facilitates comprehending how they adapted to the deployment of TOU electricity pricing precisely. Intuitively, residential consumers can respond to a peak TOU price by conserving their electricity consumption during peaks, leading to an overall reduction in their demand for electricity. Instead of reducing their electricity consumption, they choose to shift it to off-peak hours in order not to be subject to the peak rate as much as possible. In this case, the level of their net electricity consumption is maintained. Because those two ways of reacting to the time-varying tariff scheme reshape load curves around the peak rate period, it is required to examine the TOU-tariff-inducing electricity savings, as a whole, in and near the period in order to grasp households' behavioral changes. 

Regarding residential electricity demand for non-temperature-control uses, the leading reaction of the households allocated to the treatment group to the TOU tariffs was to reduce their heating-irrelevant consumption around the peak rate period. As discussed, to the magnitude of the peak-hour price changes under the TOU program, the not-for-heating electricity savings were directly proportional in the peak rate period while inversely proportional in the pre- and post-peak intervals. In the case of Tariff Group A, although there was almost zero price variation relative to the flat rate in before- and after-peak intervals, the amount of electricity savings for that group was nearly the same in all three intervals. Meanwhile, despite the price increases, the remaining tariff groups (maintained or) conserved their consumption in both pre- and post-peak intervals. In sum, the price changes in the peak rate period caused a spillover effect in those pre- and post-peak intervals: reductions in electricity consumption for non-temperature-control uses. In other words, the households allocated to the treatment group responded to the TOU program, on the whole, not through load-shifting but load-shedding. 

With respect to temperature-control-use-related household electricity consumption, Figure XYZ illustrates that the treated households' primary response to the TOU program was also load-shedding. The program caused savings in for-heating electricity use during the peak rate period, especially around moderate values of daily HDDs. In the pre-peak interval, heating-associated electricity savings occurred even though on days with low temperatures only. In the post-peak interval, although high daily HDDs incurred additional electricity consumption after introducing TOU tariffs, which might be a consequence of load-shifting or rate decline, its amount was not large enough to offset the savings in the preceding intervals.

Measuring the electricity savings of the households in Tariff Group D relative to Tariff Group A validates the load-shedding-relevant interpretation. Let's suppose that for the treated, load-shifting is a primary countermeasure against the TOU program. Then residential consumers in Tariff Group D, compared to those in Tariff Group A, had more incentive to reallocate a portion of their electricity consumption to off-peak hours because they faced a much larger price increase in the peak rate period. So in before- and after-peak intervals, the savings for Tariff Group D must be significantly smaller than those for Tariff Group A. However, Figure XYZ, which shows point estimates obtained by setting Tariff Groups A and D as the control and treatment groups, respectively, does not demonstrate a meaningful difference between them. That is, load-shifting did not play a role in reshaping households' load profiles. 

The over-HDD load profiles from pre- to post-peak intervals suggest a significant implication of the effectiveness of the TOU prices in the peak rate period. As shown in Figure XYZ, on days with high heating needs, savings from for-heating-associated electricity consumption during the pre-peak hours were directly proportional to the price increases in the peak rate period. On the contrary, the savings decreased according to the price increases during the peak rate period. Collectively, it is likely that large pre-adjustment leads to small reductions in electricity demand for heating during peaks, which in turn results in limited additional consumption during the post-peak hours. Considering that the TOU tariffs are intended to conserve electricity consumption during the peak rate period, less savings from too large pre-adjustment deteriorates the performance of the TOU tariffs.
