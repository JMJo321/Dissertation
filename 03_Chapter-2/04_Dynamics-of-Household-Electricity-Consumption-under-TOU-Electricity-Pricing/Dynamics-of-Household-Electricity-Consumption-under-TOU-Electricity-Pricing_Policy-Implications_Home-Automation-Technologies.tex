The behavioral adjustment during the pre-peak hours to temperature-control use of electricity seems to result in less savings in the peak rate period. As noted in Section XYZ, the gap in the savings from electricity consumption for temperature-control uses at a given daily HDDs between saving curves of the lowest and the highest rate changes in the peak rate period illustrates attainable savings potentially. And the potential savings could be realized by minimizing households' pre-adjustment in the pre-peak interval. In other words, technologies that confine such behavioral changes regarding electricity consumption to the peak-demand hours may improve the effectiveness of TOU electricity pricing in the peak rate period.
