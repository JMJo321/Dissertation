The results from my empirical analysis clearly indicate that under Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing, residential electricity consumption is driven by various factors, such as the timing when electricity is consumed, daily HDDs, and the magnitude of price increases in the peak rate period. In other words, within-household electricity consumption behavior shows multidimensional dynamics. Based on my empirical findings, I will discuss the dynamics in detail in the following sections. Furthermore, I will also discuss its policy implications.
