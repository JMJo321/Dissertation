        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: This figure illustrates the CER experiment in terms of TOU tariff structures. The households in the control group were subjected to a flat rate (i.e., 14.1 cents per $kWh$) during the entire experiment period. On the contrary, the treated households are assigned to one of four TOU tariff groups. And for each tariff group, there were three rate periods: night, day, and peak. Only the unit rate in the peak rate period was higher than the flat rate.}

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: The figure shows, during each experiment period, household average hourly electricity consumption for the control and treatment groups, respectively. In general, during the baseline period, households assigned to the treatment group consumed more electricity at a given hour of the day. Although both groups reduced their electricity consumption during the treatment period, the reduction in electricity consumption for the treatment group was much more remarkable for the treatment group than for the control group.}

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: The figure depicts, for households that exploit non-electric energy sources for their space and water heating, not only the average daily electricity consumption with 95\% confidence intervals for each group (red and yellow lines) but also the mean daily temperature (blue line). From this figure, it is apparent that household daily electricity consumption is negatively correlated with the average daily temperature. In other words, in Ireland, outdoor temperatures are a crucial driver of within-household electricity consumption.}

In addition, Panel B of the figure demonstrates the percentage changes in residential electricity consumption after the deployment of TOU tariff structures at different mean daily temperatures. The treatment group showed larger percentage reductions on typical winter days (roughly speaking, when the average daily temperature was lower than the value of 45$^{\circ}F$), while the control group exhibited wider percentage reductions on exceptionally cold days in Ireland.}

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: This figure depicts the time profile of half-hourly average treatment effects with 95\% confidence intervals. Standard errors are clustered at the household and date levels to adjust for serial correlation. As clearly illustrated, the treated households significantly reduced their electricity consumption during peak hours. A more interesting phenomenon is that they reduced their electricity consumption in hours leading up to and following the peak rate period, during which the applicable unit rate was lower than the flat rate in the baseline period, even though most of the estimated treatment effects are statistically insignificant in those hours. }

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: This figure is a graphical summary of the regression results in the first three columns of Table \ref{Table:Breakdown-of-Hourly-ATEs}. The order of panes corresponds to that of columns. As clearly illustrated, each two-hour interval shows distinct evolving patterns of two broad categories of household electricity consumption. The changes in non-temperature-control-driven household electricity consumption are straight lines because they are independent of outdoor temperature variations. On the other hand, the changes in temperature-control-associated residential electricity consumption are a nonlinear function of daily HDDs.}

The first row in the figure shows the treatment effects on non-temperature-control-driven household electricity consumption. The treatment effects on temperature-control-related residential electricity consumption are illustrated in the second row. The aggregate effects are presented in the last row. The first three columns correspond to the three two-hour periods (i.e., pre-peak, peak, and post-peak periods). The fourth column demonstrates the total changes in the three periods. }

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: This figure illustrates two different price schemes. Under a typical TOU electricity pricing scheme, the rate in the peak rate period is 6 cents per $kWh$ regardless of daily HDDs. On the contrary, under an alternative tariff structure that is TOU-style but has extra flexibility across daily HDDs, the peak-hour price escalates as household heating needs grow. The shaded areas depict additional gains obtained by adopting the redesigned pricing scheme, which are mainly attributable to more significant reductions in non-temperature-control-driven household electricity consumption. }
