From Figure \ref{Figure:Treatment-Effects-as-a-Linear-Function-of-Price-Changes-in-the-Peak-Rate-Period}, examining the curves that illustrate the change in temperature-control-associated electricity consumption for three consecutive periods simultaneously, but taking account of their time sequence, suggests a significant implication of the effectiveness of the TOU prices in the peak rate period. According to the figure, as the degree of peak-hour price escalation increased, the temperature-control-related consumption reduction in the pre-peak period expanded, while those in the peak period decreased gradually. Altogether, it is likely that a larger pre-adjustment leads to a smaller reduction in electricity demand for heating during peak-demand hours, which in turn seems to result in limited additional consumption during the following post-peak period. Compared to the case that a household does not reduce for-heating electricity consumption during the pre-peak period, consuming more for-heating electricity during peak hours seems necessary to prevent indoor temperatures from falling too much or persisting at a low level when the household significantly reduces its temperature-control-driven consumption during the pre-peak period.\footnote{This interpretation is in line with the concept ``discomfort'' in \cite{Smart-Thermoststs-Automation-and-Time-Varying-Prices_Blonz-et-al_2021}. See Section 3.4 in the paper.} In addition, the household will have less incentive to increase its electricity consumption for heating during post-peak hours since its room temperatures will be higher than if it were to reduce its electricity consumption for heating during peak hours considerably. In light of the fact that TOU tariffs are intended to conserve electricity consumption during peak-demand hours, it is reasonable to conclude that a lower reduction in peak hours due to a too large pre-adjustment results in a deterioration in the performance of the TOU tariffs. 

As discussed in detail, under the TOU program, households' adjustments to their behavior for temperature-control-driven electricity consumption during the pre-peak hours seem to determine the degree of a reduction in that use of electricity during the following period (i.e., during the peak rate period) in lieu of price signals. In Figure \ref{Figure:Treatment-Effects-as-a-Linear-Function-of-Price-Changes-in-the-Peak-Rate-Period}, the gap in the temperature-control-related treatment effect at given daily HDDs between the lowest and the highest peak-hour rate changes, therefore, might be understood as potentially attainable gains when the pre-adjustments are suppressed. This explanation motivates the necessity of adopting home automation technologies, like Programmable Communicating Thermostats (PCTs), to restrict such adjustments only to the peak rate period. Considering the fact that households generally set a target temperature instead of micromanaging their heating devices according to ever-changing outdoor temperatures, PCTs with recommended default settings for temperature-control-associated use of electricity are highly likely to contribute to minimizing their behavioral changes prior to the peak rate period.\footnote{\cite{Default-Effects-and-Follow-on-Behavior_Evidence-from-an-Electricity-Pricing-Program_Fowlie-et-al_2021} examines default effects in a randomized controlled trial, in which the participants assigned to the control group defaulted into a residential electricity pricing program. Default effects have been studied in a range of settings, such as organ donation \citep{Medicine_Do-Defaults-Save-Lives_Johnson-and-Goldstein_2003, The-Impact-of-Presumed-Consent-Legislation-on-Cadaveric-Organ-Donoation_Abadie-and-Gay_2006}, car insurance \citep{Framing-Probability-Distortions-and-Insurance-Decisions_Johnson-et-al_1993}, and participation in retirement savings plans \citep{Status-Quo-Bias-in-Decision-Making_Samuelson-and-Zeckhauser_1988, The-Power-of-Suggestion_Madrian-and-Shea_2001, For-Better-or-For-Worse_Choi-et-al_2019}.} Moreover, the additional gains realized by utilizing the automated instruments provide legitimacy for the ongoing SEAI-offering Home Energy Grants, in which heating controls are an essential part.\footnote{Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is Ireland's national sustainable energy authority whose goal is to promote and assist the development of sustainable energy in Ireland.
