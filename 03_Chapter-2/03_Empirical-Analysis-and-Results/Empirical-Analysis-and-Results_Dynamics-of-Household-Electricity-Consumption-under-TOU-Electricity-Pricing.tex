The preceding results from my empirical analysis highlight that households were quite responsive to incremental changes in the peak-demand-hour price. As the peak-hour price increased compared to the flat rate, non-temperature-control-related electricity consumption continued to decline in the peak rate period. In contrast, as the peak-hour price increased, temperature-control-driven consumption did indeed fall, but these reductions in residential electricity consumption occurred outside of the peak rate period (i.e., in the pre- and post-peak periods). In this section, I will further examine what can drive these different patterns in the responses to TOU prices.
