The results from my empirical analysis clearly indicate that under Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing, residential electricity consumption is governed by various factors, such as the timing of consuming electricity in a day, daily Heating Degree Days (HDDs), and the magnitude of a price increase in the peak rate period. In other words, within-household electricity consumption behavior shows multidimensional dynamics over the three drivers. Based on my empirical findings, I first discuss the mechanism through which households responded to the TOU program. Then, I will examine the dynamics in residential electricity consumption, mainly focusing on the first and third drivers. The daily-HDD-related dynamics will be discussed in the next section.
