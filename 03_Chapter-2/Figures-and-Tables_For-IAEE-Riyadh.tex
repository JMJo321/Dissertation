        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: This figure illustrates the CER experiment in terms of TOU electricity pricing. The households in the control group were subject to a flat rate (i.e., 14.1 cents per kWh) during the entire experiment period. On the contrary, the treated households are assigned to one of four TOU tariff groups. And for each tariff group, there were three rate periods: night, day, and peak. Only the unit rate in the peak rate period was higher than the flat rate.}

        \subcaption*{\textit{Note}: The figure shows household average hourly electricity consumption in the baseline and treatment periods. In general, during the baseline period, the treated households consumed more electricity at a given hour of the day. After introducing TOU tariff structures, they remarkably reduced their consumption in the peak rate period.}
