In this paper, I examine how the electricity consumption of SMUD residential customers responded to the marginal price informed through monthly bill statements under Increasing-Block Pricing (IBP). In a setting with a valid regression discontinuity design, my empirical analysis shows that households, on average, reduced their electricity consumption in response to the discontinuous price change in the marginal price in the immediately preceding billing cycle. In other words, the empirical results of my analysis reveal an inefficiency of IBP. But at the same time, the interesting response demonstrates the potential to induce desired behavioral changes in household electricity consumption by providing appropriate, even lagged, price information. On top of that, the identified response, which may be driven by a subset of households in my sample, suggests that it is also important for households to correctly understand price-related information provided in order to make optimal decisions about electricity consumption.
