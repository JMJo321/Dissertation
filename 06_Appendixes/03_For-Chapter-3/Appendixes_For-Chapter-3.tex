            This figure illustrates the estimated geologic feature for each horizontal well completed between 2013 and 2016 by year. In this figure, each square is a section in the Public Land Survey System, whereas each dot indicates an individual well's geological characteristic. It is apparent that the share of drilling of horizontal wells with (relatively) small estimates decreased significantly starting in 2014, corresponding to the beginning of the oil price crash.

In this figure, each square is a section in the Public Land Survey System, whereas each dot indicates an individual well's geological characteristic.
