We obtain geological survey data from the North Dakota Geological Survey (NDGS).\footnote{To be specific, we exploit NDGS maps GI-59 and GI-63.}  Regarding the upper and the lower Bakken shales, their estimates of thickness, thermal maturity, and total organic contents are illustrated in the geospatial data. We follow \cite{Experiential-and-Social-Learning-in-Firms_Covert_2015} to match the three geological characteristics with each horizontal well in our sample.\footnote{Refer to Section 2.4.1 of \cite{Experiential-and-Social-Learning-in-Firms_Covert_2015}.} Figure \ref{Figure:Spatial-Distributions-of-Geological-Characteristics} demonstrates the spatial distribution of well-level geological features.
