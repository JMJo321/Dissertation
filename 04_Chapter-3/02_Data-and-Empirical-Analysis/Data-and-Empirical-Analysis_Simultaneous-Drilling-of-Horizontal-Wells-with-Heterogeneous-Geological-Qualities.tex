\textit{\textbf{Simultaneous Drilling of Horizontal Wells with Heterogeneous Geological Qualities}} --- Figure \ref{Figure:Simultaneous-Drilling-of-Horizontal-Wells-with-Heterogeneous-Geological-Quality}, summarizing the estimated geological qualities of horizontal wells in scatter plots, clearly demonstrates that horizontal wells with a range of geological qualities were drilled simultaneously in the Bakken region of North Dakota. And as shown in Figure \ref{Figure:High-Sensitivity-of-Firm-Level-Low-Quality-Well-Drilling}, simultaneous drilling is observed even at the firm level. 

The simultaneous drilling empirically obtained contradicts the well-known least-cost-first extraction rule in nonrenewable resource extraction.\footnote{The cost that matters here is the marginal cost. And the marginal cost consists of two distinct costs: the marginal cost of drilling a new well and the marginal cost of extracting oil from existing wells.} According to the rule derived from the canonical Hotelling model, deposits of an exhaustible resource should be exploited in strict order, beginning with the lowest cost deposit. Because a larger estimate of the unobservable geological quality implies higher ultimate oil production, if the rule holds, wells with larger estimates, thus having lower per-barrel marginal cost, should be first extracted. Those figures, however, do not show the theoretical prediction at all. This situation calls for a new theoretical approach to rationalize the simultaneous drilling of horizontal wells with heterogeneous qualities.
