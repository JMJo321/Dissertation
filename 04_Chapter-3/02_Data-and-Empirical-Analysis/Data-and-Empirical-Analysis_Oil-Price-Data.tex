We collect the monthly per-barrel spot prices for West Texas Intermediate at the Cushing, Oklahoma from the Energy Information Administration.\footnote{Time series data for Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB is available \href{https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET\_PRI\_SPT\_S1\_M.htm}{here}.} As shown in Figure \ref{Figure:Time-Series-of-the-Number-of-Drilling-in-North-Dakota}, there was a striking movement in oil prices between 2014 and 2016. Specifically, oil prices, maintained at around \$100 per bbl during the first half of 2014, had continued to plunge, reaching less than \$50 per bbl in January 2015. After recovering to \$60 per bbl during the first half of 2015, oil prices had fallen to \$30 per bbl by the end of the year. Since then, oil prices have gradually risen until they declined again during the final quarter of 2018.
