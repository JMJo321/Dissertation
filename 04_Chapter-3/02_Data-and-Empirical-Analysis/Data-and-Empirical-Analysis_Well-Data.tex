We scrape data for well in North Dakota's Bakken region from the data portal of the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), the regulator for the drilling and production of oil and gas in North Dakota.\footnote{NDIC's well data are available at \href{https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas}{Official Portal for North Dakota State Government}.} NDIC-providing well data include a complete index of all wells permitted in North Dakota. The data contains basic information for each well, such as the type of well, completion and spud dates, location, the first and the current operator names, and targeting pool. Individual well's production and injection histories, including producing days during each month, are also contained in the data. 

Detailed well completion data are also obtained from the NDIC.\footnote{Using Form 6, Well Completion or Recompletion Report, filed by operators, the NDIC has developed the detailed data.} The data contain how much water and proppant were consumed during well simulations.

The regulatory body also provides well-level survey data. The survey data include detailed information on the path of each wellbore, including the direction and length of each lateral. 

Throughout this paper, we use the sample of 24,520 horizontal wells that targeted the Bakken pool.\footnote{The Bakken pool includes Bakken, Three Forks, and Sanish formations.} Summary statistics for those wells are presented in Table \ref{Table:Summary-Statistics-for-Wells}.
