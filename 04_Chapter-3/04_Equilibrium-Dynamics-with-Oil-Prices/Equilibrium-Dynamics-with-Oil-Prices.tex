This section examines how the time paths for optimal drilling and production vary with oil prices. Using the Implicit Function Theorem, we first predict the impact of a sudden price variation on the drilling probability, which governs the optimal paths of drilling and production. We then demonstrate how the optimal drilling and production paths respond to unexpected demand shocks. We also investigate the heterogeneous impacts of unanticipated demand shocks on drilling well sites of different quality. Finally, we compute the equilibrium paths under two different scenarios for oil prices: exogenous and endogenous oil prices.
