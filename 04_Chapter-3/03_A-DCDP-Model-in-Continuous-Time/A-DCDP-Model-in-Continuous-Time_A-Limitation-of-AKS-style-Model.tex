The theoretical framework for optimal oil drilling and extraction delineated in \cite{Hotelling-under-Pressure_AKS_2018} can be augmented by integrating heterogeneity in the quality of well locations. Suppose that the fracking firm owns well sites of different qualities, indexed by $g \in \{L(ow), H(igh)\}$, and that a homogeneous good (i.e., oil) is yielded from the sites in which new horizontal wells are drilled. Furthermore, suppose that the unit price of the output, $p$, is determined exogenously due to the firm's total production being negligible in comparison to the global market for the output. The maximization problem of the firm owning a continuum of infinitesimal well locations with disparate qualities can be articulated as follows:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model.tex}
In this formulation, two state variables $R^{g}(t)$ and $K(t)$ denote, at a given time $t$, the measure of undrilled well sites and the accessible capacity for oil flow, respectively. Moreover, two control variables $q^{g}(t)$ and $d^{g}(t)$ represent the oil production and the rate at which new horizontal wells are drilled at time t, respectively. $C(\cdot)$, indicating the total instantaneous cost of drilling, is solely a function of the drilling rate.\footnote{Regarding the total cost of oil production, we follow the assumption made in \cite{Hotelling-under-Pressure_AKS_2018}: per-barrel extraction costs from existing wells are negligible.} $I^{g}$ symbolizes the maximum oil flow from a newly drilled well. And the profit obtained at time $t$ is discounted at the interest rate $r$. 

The current-value Hamiltonian-Lagrangian of the firm's problem is
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_The-Current-Value-Hamiltonian.tex}
where $\pi_{K}$ and $\pi_{R}$ are costate variables for the state variables $K$ and $R$, respectively. $\lambda_{j}, \ j \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ are the shadow cost of each constraint.

For a given quality level $g$, two necessary conditions abstract the dynamic optimization problem:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Two-Necessary-Conditions.tex}
When horizontal wells with heterogeneous quality are drilled simultaneously (i.e., for each $g$, $d^{g}(t) >0$, which leads to $\lambda_{4}^{g}(t) = 0$), necessary condition (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_pi-K}) implies that the marginal value of an additional production capacity at time $t$ equals the marginal cost of drilling (i.e., the sum of the per-barrel shadow value of the marginal undrilled well and the per-barrel instantaneous drilling cost):
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Simplified-pi-K.tex}
In addition, when both types of horizontal well sites are not fully exhausted (i.e., for each $g$, $R^{g}(t) > 0$, which in turn $\lambda_{5}^{g}(t) = 0$), necessary condition (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_pi-R}) means that the shadow value of the marginal undrilled well at time $t$ grows at the rate of $r$:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Simplified-pi-R.tex}

Two conditions (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_Simplified-pi-K}) and (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_Simplified-pi-R}) collectively suggest that the simultaneous drilling of horizontal wells with heterogeneous quality cannot be justified in the AKS framework when $d^{g}(t) > 0$ and $R^{g}(t) > 0$, which hold before all available well sites are developed. From the two conditions, at time $t$, the marginal cost of drilling can be expressed as follows:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_The-Marginal-Cost-of-Drilling.tex}
where $C_{0}$ is a strictly positive constant.\footnote{$C_{0} = 0$ implies that the marginal cost of drilling is always zero, which in turn suggests $d^{g}(t) = 0$.} This relationship contradicts the transversality condition at the terminal time $T$, $\lim_{t \to \infty}d^{g}(t) = 0$.
