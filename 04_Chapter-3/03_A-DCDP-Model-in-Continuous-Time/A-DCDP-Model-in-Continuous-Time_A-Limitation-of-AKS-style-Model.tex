The theoretical framework for optimal oil drilling and extraction delineated in \cite{Hotelling-under-Pressure_AKS_2018} (AKS) can be augmented by integrating heterogeneity in the quality of well locations. Suppose that the fracking firm owns well sites of different qualities, indexed by $g \in \{L(ow), H(igh)\}$, and that a homogeneous good (i.e., oil) is yielded from the sites in which new horizontal wells are drilled. Furthermore, suppose that the unit price of the output, $p$, is determined exogenously due to the firm's total production being negligible in comparison to the global market for the output. The maximization problem of the firm owning a continuum of infinitesimal well locations with disparate qualities can be articulated as follows:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model.tex}
In this formulation, state variables $R^{g}(t)$ denote the measure of undrilled well sites at a given time $t$. Contrary to the original AKS model, we exclude the accessible capacity for oil flow $K(t)$ in the formulation due to the discussion in the paper that oil extractors usually operate at their production capacity constraint.\footnote{In other words, we simply assume that the capacity constraint is always binding.} Control variables $d^{g}(t)$ represent the rate at which new horizontal wells are drilled at time $t$. $\alpha^{g}$ are the quantity of oil production from the marginally drilled well. Here, we assume that $\alpha^{H} > \alpha^{L}$. $C(\cdot)$, indicating the total instantaneous cost of drilling, is solely a function of the drilling rates.\footnote{Regarding the total cost of oil production, we follow the assumption made in \cite{Hotelling-under-Pressure_AKS_2018}: per-barrel extraction costs from existing wells are negligible.} Of note, in this formulation for $C(\cdot)$, we assume that locations are perfect substitutes on the cost side. And the profit obtained at time $t$ is discounted at the interest rate $r$. 

The current-value Hamiltonian-Lagrangian of the firm's problem is
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_The-Current-Value-Hamiltonian.tex}
where $\pi^{g}_{R}$ are costate variables for the state variables $R^{g}$. $\lambda_{j}, \ j \in \{1, 2\}$ are the shadow cost of each constraint.

For a given quality level $g$, two necessary conditions characterize the firm's optimal rate of drilling:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Two-Necessary-Conditions.tex}
When horizontal wells with heterogeneous quality are drilled simultaneously (i.e., for each $g$, $d^{g}(t) >0$, which leads to $\lambda_{1}^{g}(t) = 0$), necessary condition (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_pi-K}) implies that the shadow price on the resource constraint at time $t$ equals the profit on the marginal well:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Shadow-Price-pi.tex}
In addition, when both types of horizontal well sites are not fully exhausted (i.e., for each $g$, $R^{g}(t) > 0$, which in turn $\lambda_{2}^{g}(t) = 0$), necessary condition (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_pi-R}) means that the shadow value of the marginal undrilled well at time $t$ grows at the rate of $r$:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Simplified-pi.tex}

The necessary conditions collectively suggest that the simultaneous drilling of horizontal wells with heterogeneous quality cannot be justified in the AKS framework when $d^{g}(t) > 0$ and $R^{g}(t) > 0$, which hold before all available well sites are developed. The followings stem from equation (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_Shadow-Price-pi}):
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_AKS-Style-Model_Conditions-for-Contradiction.tex}
Here, based on equation (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_Necessary-Conditions_pi-R}), the equation (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_pi-dots}) implies $\pi^{H} = \pi^{L}$. However, this equality contradicts equation (\ref{Equation:AKS-Style-Model_difference-between-pis}) because $\alpha^{H} > \alpha^{L}$, which implies $\pi^{H} > \pi^{L}$. 

The contradiction could be attributable to not introducing any constraint for the rate of drilling (i.e., $d^{g}(t)$, \ $g \in \{ L, H \}$). As discussed in Section \ref{C3-SubSubSection:Correlation-between-Oil-Prices-and-Horizontal-Drilling-in-ND}, limited extraction capacity can change the standard order of extraction. However, in the current framework, setting the upper bound of an extraction-related constraint seems too arbitrary and complicates drawing implications from necessary conditions. From the empirical perspective, it is also intractable to quantify the margin for market-wide, or firm-wide, extraction capacity for each drilling decision. Furthermore, empirical estimation of the model from microeconomic data on drilling and production is, in general, too demanding. Those difficulties call for a new theoretical approach to build a framework that thoroughly explains our empirical findings for drilling decisions made by fracking firms in North Dakota.
