In the continuous-time DCDP framework, the social planner's problem is given by
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Formulation.tex}
In this formulation, we further assume that fracking firms will have additional new well sites (denoted $E$) augmented at a constant rate due to their exploration efforts. The first two terms in the square bracket collectively mean the net utility from the output (i.e., oil or gas) produced by drilling well sites at time $t$. The rest in the square bracket represents the expected value of choice-specific cost shocks for the undeveloped well sites at time $t$.\footnote{Another interpretation of what the terms in the square bracket mean as a whole is the sum of the net (expected) payoff obtained from the marginally drilled well site $\left( \text{i.e., } u(\alpha R_{t} Pr_{t}) - c(R_{t} Pr_{t}) + R_{t} Pr_{t} \sigma \big( \gamma - \ln(Pr_{t}) \big) \right)$ and the (expected) gains from the available but not yet drilled well locations $\left( \text{i.e., } R_{t} (1 - Pr_{t}) \sigma \big( \gamma - \ln(1 - Pr_{t}) \big) \right)$.}

The current-value Hamiltonian-Lagrangian of the social planner's problem is given by
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Hamiltonian-Lagrangian.tex}

The necessary conditions of the current-value Hamiltonian-Lagrangian are as follows:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions.tex}

The costate variable $\pi_{t}$ can be expressed as a function of $R_{t}$ and $Pr_{t}$ from condition (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions_Drilling-Probability}) if $Pr_{t} \in (0,1)$ (i.e., $\lambda_{2,t}, \lambda_{3,t} = 0$):
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions_Meaning-of-Costate-Variable.tex}
And when $R_{t} > 0$, condition (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions_Costate-Variable}) is given by
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions_Simplified-Costate-Variable.tex}
We will discuss the implications of those two conditions later. 

The social planner's problem has a unique steady state $(R_{ss}, \pi_{ss})$. By definition, each of the two state variables of the dynamic optimization problem is on its nullcline at the steady state. In other words, the change in each of them is zero at the steady state (i.e., $\dot{R}_{ss}, \dot{\pi}_{ss} = 0$). From necessary conditions (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_Law-of-Motion}) and (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_Necessary-Conditions_Costate-Variable}), it is obvious that at steady state $R_{t}$ and $\pi_{t}$ satisfy the following equations:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_System-of-Equations-for-Steady-State.tex}
On top of the equations, necessary condition (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_Meaning-of-Costate-Variable}) has to hold at the steady state simultaneously. Solving the system of three equations, we can uniquely identify $(R_{ss}, \pi_{ss})$, including the value of the control variable at the steady state (i.e., $Pr_{ss}$). Of note, the first equation in (\ref{Equation:Social-Planners-Problem_System-of-Equations-for-Steady-State}) demonstrates that $R_{ss}$ can be positive if $E \neq 0$.

The steady state $(R_{ss}, \pi_{ss})$ has the saddle property.\footnote{Refer to \textit{9.5 Steady states in autonomous infinite-horizon problems} in \cite{Optimal-Control-Theory-and-Static-Optimization-in-Economics_Leonard-and-Long_1992}.} Using a Taylor series approximation, $\dot{R}_{t}$ and $\dot{\pi}_{t}$ can be linearized near the steady state\footnote{Details are provided in \ref{C3-Appendix_Derivations_Linearization-near-the-Steady-State-of-the-Social-Planners-Problem}.}:
\input{04_Chapter-3/00C_Equations/Equation_Social-Planners-Problem_Linearized-System-of-Equation-near-Steady-State.tex}
Since the determinant of the coefficient matrix is negative, the steady state of the infinite-horizon maximization problem is a saddle point, which is demonstrated in Figure \ref{Figure:Phase-Diagram_Saddle-Point}.
